This is a sample authentication server for the Galene videoconference
server <https://galene.org>.  It implements two distinct authorisation
flows: it may act as an "authorisation server", where Galene's Javscript
code consults the server, or as an "authorisation portal", where the user
logs into the portal which then securely redirects to Galene.

This example was written in Python and designed to be easy to understand
and to extend.  For a more useful example, written in Go, please see

# Preliminaries

In either case, you should first modify the function `user_permissions` to
do authentication suitable for your site, for example by consulting an
LDAP database.  Then, generate a JWK:

    jose jwk gen -i '{"alg":"ES256"}' -o private.jwk
    jose jwk pub -i private.jwk -o public.jwk

# Use as an authentication server

Run the server:

    python galene-sample-auth-server.py -k private.jwk -p 1234

Configure the group in Galene:

    {
        "authServer": "http://localhost:1234/",
        "authKeys": [
            {...insert public key here... }
        ]
    }

# Use as an authentication portal

Run the server:

    python galene-sample-auth-server.py -k private.jwk -p 1234 -r https://galene.example.org:8443/

Configure the group in Galene:

    {
        "authPortal": "http://galene.example.org:1234/",
        "authKeys": [
            {...insert public key here... }
        ]
    }
